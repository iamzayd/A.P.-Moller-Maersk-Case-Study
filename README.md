This repository contains code for a machine learning project that predicts product sourcing data for June 2021, given historical data from July 2020 to May 2021.

The project utilizes machine learning, deep learning and time series models for forecasting. Three python notebooks are created for each product and models are trained for each of them to understand how they perform:

- prediction-ntm1_done.ipynb
- prediction-ntm2_done.ipynb
- prediction-ntm3_done.ipynb

## Data Description:

Training Set: July 2020 - May 2021 (used to train the models)
Test Set: June 2021 (data predicted by the models)

## Project Goals:

Utilize NTM models to predict sourcing data for June 2021 as accurately as possible.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
Implement strategies to handle outliers and data quality issues.
Compare and evaluate the performance of different NTM approaches.
Select a final NTM model and justify the choice.

## Getting Started:

Clone this repository.
Feel free to run any notebook;
but it is recommended to follow the following order
1. `prediction-ntm1_done.ipynb`
2. `prediction-ntm2_done.ipynb`
3. `prediction-ntm3_done.ipynb`

The code within the notebooks is optimized but not a lot and may require adjustments for best performance like using GridSearchCV to get the best parameters.
Comments are added within the notebooks for easier explaination of the code's functionality and decision-making process.
